### Directions: Create a series of functions that interact with our `pets` array.

#### Problem #1
Create a function called `filterByMedication` that takes in two parameters - `array` and `medication`. `array` represents an array of pet objects; `medication` represents a string of medication. This function should use the native filter method to return a new array of only the pets that use the target medication.
